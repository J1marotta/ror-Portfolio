# For our first major project at Coder Academy in Sydney.

### You are to design, build, deploy and present a portfolio website.

## The website needs to have the following information:

		1. Your name and contact details.
		2. Links to your Github and LinkedIn accounts.
		3. Information about you to demonstrate your personality.
		4. Your study and work history.

You are allowed to use a CSS library such as Bootstrap
or even a theme you found on the internet.
It is advised that you demonstrate you have customised the library or theme.


## Deliverables

### Design Documentation
    1. Demonstrate your understanding of your site's audience.

Concepts should be clear,
this is a portfolio of work, it can be fun
and showcase skill but it needs to be professional as
potential employers will be looking at it.
I will be using bootstrap where possible.

 	2. Demonstrate the design decisions made:

##### Key concepts I know I want to include


~~Disappearing nav bar when scrolling, and a goto top button~~

 * ##### Instead include Parrallax and single page above the fold

>I had this idea of a single page website which had static images and when you scroll it would push the content up into view on a parrallax. adding a depth and having the scrolling content on a higher Z index and with shadows to formulate the depth.
>
>The parrallax and fixed positions unfortunately looked terrible and I
was forced to abandon it.
>

###### _Lessons learned_
Style has to be updated to fit more modern conventions.

My wireframe idea looked quite good but technically it was proving really difficult to make it not look like it was from the 80s, fixed images also don't scale well for mobiles and building a website that doesn't work on mobile to showcase myself isn't the best start.

It was rewarding learning how to get this working and exciting when I had the slick sliding function, but overall it looked tacky and cheap.

I will consider this a todo for the future to revisit this concept utilising future technical skills.

* ##### Snake Minigame. pj5.js
> Snake was a bit ambitious as an easter egg, but I really enjoy the idea of some interaction with the user, so I managed to implement an example from p5.js
> seen here https://p5js.org/
>
>Which is a really cool js framework that allows for fun and quite easily implementation of graphics and art. You can create a canvas and track mouse conditions inside the area and easily draw objects based on the input.
>
> My new redesign will feature a large area for this to occupy the user.


###### _Lessons learned_

The main focus here was to include a fun easter egg, and also also for some interaction to excite the user.

Wednesday 6th
Easter eggs should be value adds, and unfortunately after an entire redesign learning the logic for snake is a bit too overwhelming.  

With the working prototype of the new p5.js example instead it will feature in my redesign.

* ##### Color changing ~~background~~ Name plaque - Implemented JS
>One feature I really enjoyed from another website is a large section which changed color based on mouse click, I wanted to reimplement this as a name plaque in my one page design.

###### _Lessons learned_

This was a cool trick to learn, it involved learning about EventHandlers in js, I was able to get it working with only a few lines of code, and infact found two different ways to make it work; both were only a few lines of code, but it was an enjoyable learning curve and getting it to work was quite rewarding.

Limiting the color choices in the future will improve the aesthetics as one of the ways involved randomly asigning hex codes using MATH.random, while it allowed for semi-infinite colors, it also allowed or some really ugly ones.

It will still be a feature point of my new design and a larger size frame will allow the color to pop more.

---
* Scaleable portfolio section with mouse interaction.
-- Carousel on separate separate page

* vr room
* contact us page  -- link with a modal?
* link to browse happy for outdated browsers  
* ~~main page above the fold~~ proved ugly, reverted idea to scrolling.
* simple and effective mobile design -- original idea did not lend to
mobile well at all, which is a terrible strategy.

---Updated second wireframe

* design must be easy to navigate.
* black and white, color on hover.




		3. Demonstrate that you considered usability heuristics

My portfolio should be able to tick the 10 heuristics from this page

		5. Style guide
Main focus is professional clean image.
Reactive tiles for sections to navigate put on a parrallax;
Focus on black and white and color only on hover.
